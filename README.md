# Auto Reveal (7 Seconds)

An Anki addon that automatically flips the card and shows the answer after a 7-second delay.

## Why?

When reviewing flashcards, it's easy to fall into the trap of overthinking — spending 30 seconds trying to drag a half-remembered word out of your brain, only to realize you were wrong anyway.

This addon is for people who want to avoid that trap.

Instead of relying on willpower to "give up" and flip the card, this addon flips it for you after a set delay — giving you just enough time to attempt recall, but not enough to spiral into obsessive guessing.

In short: it's not about being lazy.  
It's about being kind to your brain.
