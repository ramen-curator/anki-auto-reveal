# Auto Reveal (Customizable Answer Timer)

An Anki addon that automatically flips the card and shows the answer after a delay.

## Why?

When reviewing flashcards, it's easy to overthink — spending 30+ seconds struggling to remember a word or concept, often ending in frustration.

This addon helps break that cycle by automatically showing the answer after a set time.  
Just enough to test recall, but not long enough to get stuck.

It’s not about being lazy.  
It’s about being kind to your brain.

## Features

- Automatically shows the answer side after a user-defined delay
- Supports custom note types and deck name filters
- Optional longer delay for cards tagged as `longform`
- Lightweight, non-intrusive, self-contained
- Works with most Anki versions (tested on 25.02+)
- GUI-based configuration (no code editing required)

MIT. You can use it, modify it, or ignore it. Just don't set it to 0 seconds — that’s cheating.
